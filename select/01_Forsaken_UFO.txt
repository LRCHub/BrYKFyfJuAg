Well I guess I never saw it coming
Guess I never had a chance
Now I see your love light
Fading baby
Didn't ever think I'd lose your romance
Baby I've always loved you
Maybe I could've shown you more

The kids the house and everything
Pushed you to walking out the door
This empty house
This empty room
The still and quiet
There's no more moon
The traffic sounds pass the freeway sign
Another drink
I'm losing time

Hold her tightly and don't let her go
Hold her forever
Just let it show

The daily chore the daily news
The daily work the daily blues
The days the months the months to years
Until I see the dying tears

Was a little belief and I know I am looking for a miracle
The sands of time is running out
A little world a little doubt

Hold her forever
Just let it show
Hold her tightly and don't let her go

This empty house
This empty room
The still and quiet
There's no more moon
The traffic sounds pass the freeway sign
Another drink
I'm losing time

The daily chore the daily news
The daily work the daily blues
The days the months the months to years
Until I see the dying tears
