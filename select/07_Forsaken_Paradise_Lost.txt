What we don't know will set us free
Until tomorrow
What we don't show the enemy
Breaks them all to follow
What we don't show can never be
Until tomorrow
What we don't see, the agony
Await the call of sorrow
Reverence, you're taking
We're all forsaken
Reverence, mistaken
We're all forsaken
We're all forsaken
What we don't show, affinity
Until tomorrow
Cannot breathe, cannot flee
Break them all to follow
Reverence, you're taking
We're all forsaken
Reverence, mistaken
We're all forsaken
We're all forsaken
What we don't know will set us free
Until tomorrow
The purest deep, an empty sea
Break them all to follow
Reverence, you're taking
We're all forsaken
Reverence, mistaken
We're all forsaken
Reverence, you're taking
We're all forsaken
Reverence, mistaken
We're all just faking
