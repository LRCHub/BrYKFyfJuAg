Forbidden kiss
Baby, tell me
We're on a way to Moonlight Traveling
Can't get fell asleep there's something crazy
going on
My heart gets overheated just because of you
I tried to find a word but it's ail vanished
into the air
Shall we have a drink before I start to cry?
Every time when I touch your inside
Another music comes out to my sanctuary
We're had to find the truth of this game
I don't wanna losing your love
Forsaken kiss
Please tell me what you are thinking
Stars falling tonight
(Yeah, only just two of us)
I've been waiting, longing, craving for your
love
Because I trapped, fascinated, you know? (Yeah,
only just two of us)
Feels like burning, raging, please don't ever
stop singing a lullaby
Forever it's you (Moonlight Traveling)
Crescent moonlight, hold tight
Cannot take my eyes away from your shine
Lights up this empty room
Gotta find out evidence of love before I get
drown into you
Ignore that silly rules even we don't care about
it right?
This world goes round and round, so I gotta
repaint it new
Before I fell in love there was nothing more to
say about
Now I can not go back I'm addicted to your heart
So give it away
Don't be afraid
I'm in a prison of appetition
Some of the toxins killing me softly
(Stare at each other)
Crying like a lost child
Trying not to be broken
(But… why?) cause
I don't wanna losing your love
Before my beautiful heaven breaking over
I'll take away my angel
No matter what is waiting for us
Yes, I'll never losing your love
Close your eyes
Can't you see my heartbeat going faster
No one's gonna hurt anymore
Illuminated by the lonely moonshine
I…I don't wanna losing your love
Forsaken kiss
Please tell me what you're thinking
Stars falling tonight
(Yeah, only just two of us)
I've been waiting, longing, craving for your
love
Because I'm trapped, fascinated, you know?
(Yeah, only just two of us)
Feels like burning, raging, please don't ever
stop singing a lullaby
Forever it's you (Moonlight Traveling)
Crescent moonlight, hold tight
Cannot take my eyes away from your shine
Lights up this empty room
I remember that sweetest kiss that you gave me
in a flash
(Gotta find out evidence of love before I get
drown into you)
