So solitary
Just arid
Not a single human in sight

A waste barren land
Just sand
Not a single seedling in sight

The right to live just vanished for good
As the speeches of a brotherhood
Vague memories of joy
Of mellowing girls and boys

In my heart and
In my soul
It hollers out
Why oh why
Have we destroyed such beauty
Oh why oh why
Have we forsaken ourselves

A heatwave occurs
Just a blur
Not a single rain drop in sight

With brilliant brains we were blessed
The thoughts of ourselves as the best
Turned out so wrong
A fallacy all along

In my heart and
In my soul
It hollers out
Why oh why
Have we destroyed such beauty
Oh why oh why
Have we forsaken ourselves

Why have we forsaken ourselves

In my heart and
In my soul
It hollers out
Why oh why
Have we destroyed such beauty
Oh why oh why
Have we forsaken ourselves

Why have we forsaken ourselves
